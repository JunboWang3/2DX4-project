# Microprocessor-Systems-Project
Studying and performing 8 labs gradually gave me an understanding of how to build embedded systems, culminating in a project involving spatial mapping using time-of-flight sensors. For the first three labs, I learned to manipulate digital signals using assembly language, develop digital locks through finite state machines, and interface analog signals with the ADC of a microcontroller. From Labs 4 to 6, you'll explore duty cycle and pulse timing, which are critical for managing devices such as LEDs and motors. Additionally, there is the need to interface with complex peripherals and add complexity to devices such as keyboards and LED displays to prepare for system integration. Finally, Labs 7 and 8 demonstrate real-time data acquisition and processing by implementing efficient programmed interrupts and applying these techniques to collect and process distance data using a Time-of-Flight sensor.
In this project, I designed and built an embedded spatial measurement system that utilizes ToF sensors for 360-degree environmental mapping. This involved manually and Python programming to control stepper motors to rotate the sensors and collect spatial data in my room, which would eventually be processed and transferred to a PC for visualization.
